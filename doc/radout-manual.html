<a name="DESCRIPTION"> <h2> Description </h2> </a>
<div>
	Software extension for Autocad/Intellicad to export data to the Radiance
	lighting simulation package of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
<p>
    Autocad/Intellicad entities can be selected and filtered in various ways.
<p>
    Entities are sorted either by color or by layer.
    The sorting results in seperate files written for every layer or color.
	Optionally other files can be created.
    This includes initial material definitions
    (plastic with the color as visible in autocad), a setup of sun
    and sky and a rif file as direct input to rad(1).
<p>
    Only entities that are visible (that is their layer is on and thawed)
    will be exported, even when nested in a selected block. This provides
	another method of filtering elements of your drawing and is especially
	useful when you want to update only part of a scene.
<p>
    The layer name or color number will be part of each respective filename
	to make it an unique identifier. The pipe character "|" used by
	Autocad/Intellicad within layernames associated with externally referenced
	blocks, as well as the dollar sign "$" are replaced by an underscore "_" as
	they are illegal or at least confusing characters for filenames on most
	systems.
</div>


<a name="INSTALLATION"> <h2> Installation </h2> </a>
<div>
	Radout is "installed", if the files radout.arx and radout.dcl 
	are placed in a location which is included in
    your Autocad/Intellicad support search path.
	This support path is configured from the "Options" dialog.
<p>
	Load the program through the APPLOAD dialog or 
	by entering <code>(arxload&nbsp;"radout")</code>
	(including the parens) at the Autocad/Intellicad command prompt. 
</div>



<a name="INTERFACE"> <h2> Interface </h2> </a>
<div>
	The program is started by typing <code>radout</code> at the
	Autocad/Intellicad command prompt.
    This will open a dialog box to configure all export options:
<p>

</div>

<a name="OPTIONS"> <h2> Options </h2> </a>
<div>
<h4>Write Filetypes:</h4>
		The settings in the upper right frame  specify which file types
		to export:
		<p>
		Radout does not edit the exported files. Every time you export data,
		any existing files with the same names will be overwritten
		without warning.
<dl>
<p><dt>
        Geometry files <dd>
            This switch is on by default, as it is the basic purpose
            of the program. Turning it off will disable the list of sampled
            entity types and the sampling mode selection.

<p><dt> Materials file <dd>
            The materials of the exported objects will have
            the same color (a plastic) as they appear with in autocad.

<p><dt> Radiance Input File (rif) <dd>
            This file can be given to the rad(1) program and contains
			the basic information needed to run a simulation.

<p><dt> Exterior daylight file <dd>
            This option sets the parameters of natural lighting as
			required by gensky.
			The input fields activated by this option determine
			your location (Longitude/Latitude) and time of day and year
			(Month/Day/Hour/Timezone).

</dl>

<h4>Sampling modes:</h4>
		The settings in the lower right frame let you specify the way the
		geometry will be converted.

<dl>
<p><dt> Assign materials by: <dd>
<dl>
            Select the sorting method out of the following.
<p><dt> Color <dd>
                The Autocad/Intellicad color number as visible on the screen.
                This is the default and will help you when you organize
                your drawing "visually".

<p><dt> Layer <dd>
                The layer of every subentity (the one which this entity
                is created on). Choose this method if you use a conceptual
                layering system independently from screen display colors.

</dl>
<p>         The concept of floating layers and colors within (nested)
            blocks is fully supported. That means a subentity within a
            block with on layer "0" and/or with the color "byblock" will
            appear on the layer and with the color of the containing block.
            This continues recursively if the block has those properties as
            well until a level with explicitly defined properties or the
            top level block is reached.  Toplevel entities with the
            color "byblock" are drawn with color nr. 7 (white).


<p><dt> Distance Tolerance for arc approx: <dd>
            Arc entities and arc segments of polylines have to be meshed
            for the use in Radiance. This value specifies
            how smooth these meshes will appear in the final image.
            Higher values will make smoother surfaces.
			The default of 0.1. It is recommended to test for
			optimised settings, balancing file size and visual accuracy,
			since the optimal settings depends on the size and scale
			of your model.

<p><dt> Angle Tolerance for arc approx: <dd>
			(This option is not available for all versions of Radout)
			The surface normal of neighbouring mesh elements will not
			differ by more than this amount in degrees. The default
			is 15.0 degrees, which usually gives reasonable results.
			The effect of this setting is independent of model size
			and complexity. Please note that very low values (eg. below 2.0
			degrees) can lead to unreasonably big output files and may even
			crash Autocad/Intellicad when running out of memory.

<p><dt> Output scaling factor<dd>
		Output geometry will be scaled according to this factor. Radiance
		preferrably uses international (SI) units, ie. meters.

</dl>

<h4>Geometry to Export:</h4>
		The switches in the left column specify which entity types get
		extracted from your drawing and what type of surface they will
		result in.
		By default all entities that visible as a surface in Autocad/Intellicad
		(opaque for the hide and shade/render commands) are activated.
		Some other entity types can be used to simplify modelling but are
		rendered differentely in Autocad/Intellicad than in Radiance.
		Those are off by default and have to be enabled by the user explicitly.
		<p>
		All polygons should keep their orientation as created in
		Autocad/Intellicad determined by the right hand rule as explained in
		the Radiance tutorial.
        Entities extruded by thickness will be inverted if their thickness
		value (or "PDSIZE" for point entities) is negative.
		2d-Polylines and lightweight polylines are treated the same.
<p>
        The supported export types and their results are:
<dl>
<p><dt> 3DFACEs <dd>
            3dfaces will be split to two triangular polygons if not planar.
<p><dt> Extruded TRACEs <dd>
            Traces will appear as a single polygon or as a box if the
            thickness is non-zero.
<p><dt> Extruded SOLIDs <dd>
            Solids will appear as a single polygon or as a box if the
            thickness is non-zero.
<p><dt> Extruded CIRCLEs <dd>
            Circles will appear as a ring with a inner radius of zero
            or as a cylinder/tube with a ring at either end if their
            thickness is non-zero.
<p><dt> Extruded ARCs <dd>
            Arcs with non-zero thickness will be segmented
            according to the given arc tolerance.
<p><dt> Extruded LINEs <dd>
            Lines with non-zero thickness will appear as a single polygon.
<p><dt> Extruded 2D-PLINEs <dd>
            2d-polylines with non-zero thickness will appear
            as a set of polygons.
<p><dt> Wide 2D-PLINEs <dd>
            2d-polylines with a non-zero starting width set in
            their header entity (not the vertexes!) will appear as a
            polygon following the trace of the polyline with a constant
            width. This option will override the one below for poly-
            lines that match both categories.
            Together with a thickness and the respective option set this
            will will result in a kind of a quadrilateral worm.
<p><dt> 3D-MESHes <dd>
            The Faces of 3d-polygon meshes will appear as a set of
            polygons ignoring spline fits of any kind. Nonplanar faces
            will be split into two triangles.
<p><dt> POLYFACEs <dd>
            The faces of polyface meshes will
            appear as a set of polygons. Nonplanar faces will be split
            into two triangles.
<p><dt> Closed 2d-PLINES <dd>
            2d-polylines with the closed flag set in their header entity
            will appear as a polygon of the shape of the polyline.
            Polylines with a width will not follow this rule if the
            respective option above is chosen as well (Wide 2d-plines).
            Together with a thickness and the respective option set this
            will result in a prismatic volume of the shape of the polyline.
            This option is off by default. 
<p><dt> POINTs as Spheres <dd>
            Point entities will appear as spheres or bubbles depending on
            either their thickness (if any) or else the value of the
			Autocad/Intellicad system variable "PDSIZE". if the result is zero
			the entity is ignored.
            This option is off by default.
<p><dt> ACIS entities <dd>
			The three items relating to ACIS solid modelling entities
			may be disabled for very old Autocad/Intellicad releases.

</dl>

<h4>File Names:</h4>
<dl>
<p><dt> Basename for Output:<dd>
        The names of all output files will start
        with the string entered here. Default is the name of the drawing
        file.
</dl>

<h4> OK/Cancel buttons  </h4>
        The OK button starts the exporting after you have selected the
        entities you wish to extract. The Cancel button discards all the
        setting you have made and terminates the program.

<a name="REQUIREMENTS"> <h2> Requirements </h2> </a>
<div>
    Radout is meant to run with Autocad R12 and up,
	and for Intellicad 2000 and up.
<p>
	Most recent actively supported Platforms were Autocad 2000 (R13)
	and Intellicad 2004.
</div>


<a name="CAVEATS"> <h2> Caveats </h2> </a>
<div>
    Please note that the AME solid modelling package by Autodesk as
	included in Autocad R10-R12 generates
    surfaces with surface normals pointing to the inside of the created
    volumes (at least most of the times).
<p>
    Models created with the AME Solid modelling package must have surfaces
    defined with the command "SOLMESH". Otherwise they consist of only
    wireframe information wich cannot be extracted by Radout.
<p>
    The "SOLID" entities in Autocad/Intellicad, which can be extracted with the
    "Extruded and flat Solids" option, have nothing to do with solid
    modelling, AME or ACIS. These are a feature out of the 2D days of
	Autocad and are just flat quadrilateral faces which appear solidly
	filled when viewed from top. They form quadrilateral prisms if
	extruded, which can only be done in a right angle to their ground plane.

<p>
	Custom entity types defined by 3rd party applications ("proxies",
	previously "zombies") are ignored, with the notable exception of
	ACIS solid modelling entities.
</div>

<a name="BUGS"> <h2> Bugs </h2> </a>
<div>
	For multiple inserts, only one item is exported.
<p>
	On SGI systems, if the last (closing) segment of a polyline is an arc,
	it may end up in a very strange position. This happens most often with
	donuts.
