<h1>dxf2rad 1.1.0 <br> Convert Geometry from DXF to Radiance</h1>

<div>

- Complete reference and user guide.

</div>

<h2>What is dxf2rad:</h2>
<div>

Dxf2rad is a command line utility for translating geometry
data from the DXF file format into the format understood by the
<a href="http://www.radiance-online.org/">Radiance</a>
lighting simulation package.
<p>
Dxf2rad shares a lot of code with
<a href="http://www.schorsch.com/en/download/radout/">Radout</a>,
an Autocad extension to export geometry directly from within a drawing.
It was written to support the architectural lighting design
software package <b><a href="http://www.schorsch.com/en/software/rayfront/">Rayfront</a></b>,
which offers complete control over all parameters of a Radiance simulation.

</div>

<h2>Features</h2>
<div>
<ul type=square>
<li>Any DXF file in a valid format as specified with any release
	of Autocad can be converted.
<li>All hiding/shading entities from Autocad can be converted, and some more
	(ACIS solids in DXF files by R14 and Autocad 2000, as well as other
	objects defined by third party applications are not supported).
<li>Blocks are fully supported, as long as the file actually
	contains their definitions.
<li>Output primitives will have modifiers based on the layer of each
	entity in the form "l_&lt;layer&gt;".
    Floating layers within blocks are fully supported.
<li>The output can be scaled by an arbitrary factor.
<li> Entity types can be filtered through command line switches.
<li> Option to write each named view defined in the DXF file into a Radiance
	view file.
</ul>

    Entities exported (by choice):
