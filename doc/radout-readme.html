<h2>What is Radout:</h2>
<div>

Radout is an application for Autocad/Intellicad, exporting geometry data to the
<a href="http://www.radiance-online.org/">Radiance</a>
lighting simulation package.
<p>
Radout is conceptually based on the old
<a href="http://www.schorsch.com/en/download/torad/">torad.lsp</a> program,
which provided the inspiration and some of the understanding of autocad's
workings to the original author Philip Thompson.
<br>
The main differences are:

<ul>
	<li> Compiled in C/C++, executes many times faster.
	<li> Creates a simple rif file for immediate input to rad(1).
	<li> Some bugs avoided, some new introduced.
	<li> Much better arc/bulge approximation.
	<li> Exports light weight polylines in R14 and up.
</ul> 

	Radout is an integral part of the architectural lighting design
	software package
	<a href="http://www.schorsch.com/en/software/rayfront/">Rayfront</a>,
	which offers complete control over all parameters of
	Radiance simulations.

<h2>Features</h2>
<div>
<ul type=square>
<li> Translates all hiding/shading entities from Autocad/Intellicad, including
ACIS solids.
<li> Entities can be selected on screen for selective export.
<li> Entities sorted either by color or by layer.
    The sorting results in seperate files written for every layer or color.
    Floating layers and colors within blocks are fully supported.
<li> Other files created optionally can contain material definitions,
	 a setup of sky and sun, and a rif file.
<li> Only the entities that are visible (that is their layer is on and thawed)
    will be exported, even when nested in a selected block. This gives you
    another method of filtering elements of your drawing especially usefull
    when you want to update only part of a scene.
<li> The layer name or color number will be part of each respective filename
    to make it an unique identifier.
<li> You have full control through a interactive dialog box.
</ul>

    Entities exported (by choice):
