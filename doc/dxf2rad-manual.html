<a name="descr"><h2>Description</h2></a>
<div>
	Dxf2rad is a command line utility for translating geometry
	data from the DXF file format into the format understood by the
	<a href="http://www.schorsch.com/rayfront/radiance.html">Radiance</a>
	lighting simulation package.
<p>
    DXF entities can be filtered by command line options.
<p>
	Output primitives will have modifiers based on the layer of each
	entity in the form "l_&lt;layer&gt;".
    Floating layers within blocks are fully supported.
    "Funny characters" in the layer name will replaced by an underscore
	each.
<p>



</div>

<a name="install"><h2>Installation</h2></a>
<div>
    Dxf2rad is a standalone application that doesn't require any
	special installation procedures. If the binary is somewhere
	on your $PATH, then you can call it anywhere without restriction.

<a name="options"><h2>Options</h2></a>

<dl compact="compact">

<p><dt><b>-h</b><dd>
            Print a short usage description to the console and exit.
<p><dt><b>-H</b><dd>
            Print the copyright and free license statements and exit.
<p><dt><b>-v</b><dd>
			Verbose: Report progress on standard error (repeating
			this option increases verbosity).

<p><dt><b>-s scale</b><dd>
			All output will be scaled by the scale factor.


<p><dt><b>-d dtol</b><dd>
		Distance Tolerance for arc approximation.
            Arc entities and arc segments of polylines have to be meshed
            for the use in Radiance. This value specifies
            how smooth these meshes will appear in the final image.
            Higher values will make smoother surfaces.
			The default of 0.1. It is recommended to test for
			optimised settings, balancing file size and visual accuracy,
			since the optimal setting depends on the size and scale
			of your model.

<p><dt><b>-a atol</b><dd>
		Angle Tolerance for arc approximation.
			The surface normal of neighbouring mesh elements will not
			differ by more than this amount in degrees. The default
			is 15.0 degrees, which usually gives reasonable results.
			The effect of this setting is independent of model size
			and complexity. Please note that very low values (eg. below 2.0
			degrees) can lead to unreasonably big output files and may even
			crash dxf2rad when running out of memory.

<p><dt><b>-s scale</b><dd>
	Output scaling factor.
		Output geometry will be scaled according to this factor. Radiance
		preferrably uses international (SI) units, ie. meters.


<p><dt><b>+e str</b><dd> Include entities
<dt><b>-e str</b><dd> Exclude entities
<p>
		"str" is a string of characters out of the following,
		specifying which entity types are to be included
		or excluded.
         By default
        all entities that define a surface in Autocad (opaque for the
        hide and shade/render commands) are included.
        All polygons keep their orientation as created in Autocad
        determined by the right hand rule as explained in the Radiance
        tutorial.
        Entities extruded by thickness will be inverted if their thickness
        value (or "PDSIZE" for point entities) is negative.
		2d-polilines and lightweight polylines are treated the same.
<p><dl>
<p><dt><b>a</b> - 3D FACEs<dd>
            3dfaces will be split to two triangular polygons if not planar.
<p><dt><b>b</b> - Extruded and flat 2D SOLIDs <dd>
            Solids will appear as a single polygon or as a box if the
            thickness is non-zero.
<p><dt><b>c</b> - Extruded TRACEs <dd>
            Traces will appear as a single polygon or as a box if the
            thickness is non-zero.
<p><dt><b>d</b> - Extruded 2D PLINEs <dd>
            2d-polylines with a non-zero thickness will appear
            as a set of polygons.
<p><dt><b>e</b> - Wide 2D PLINEs <dd>
            2d-polylines with a non-zero starting width set in
            their header entity (not the vertexes!) will appear as a
            polygon following the trace of the polyline with a constant
            width. This option will override the polygon option for polylines
			that match both categories.
            Together with a thickness and the respective option set this
            will will result in a kind of a quadrilateral worm.
<p><dt><b>f</b> - Closed 2d PLINES as polygons<dd>
            2d-polylines with the closed flag set in their header entity
            will appear as a polygon of the shape of the polyline.
            polylines with a width will not follow this rule if
            wide 2D-PLINEs are selected as well.
            Together with a thickness and the respective option set this
            will result in a prismatic volume of the shape of the polyline.
            This option is off by default.
<p><dt><b>g</b> - 3D MESHes <dd>
            The Faces of 3d-polygon meshes will appear as a set of
            polygons ignoring spline fits of any kind. Nonplanar faces
            will be split into two triangles.
<p><dt><b>h</b> - POLYFACEs <dd>
            The faces of polyface meshes will
            appear as a set of polygons. Nonplanar faces will be split
            into two triangles.
<p><dt><b>i</b> - Extruded LINEs <dd>
            Lines with a non-zero thickness will appear as a
            single polygon each.
<p><dt><b>j</b> - Extruded ARCs <dd>
            Arcs with a non-zero thickness will be segmented
            according to the given arc tolerance values.
<p><dt><b>k</b> - Extruded and flat CIRCLEs <dd>
            Circles will appear as a ring with a inner radius of zero
            or as a cylinder/tube with a ring at either end if their
            thickness is non-zero.
<p><dt><b>l</b> - POINTs as Spheres <dd>
            Point entities will appear as spheres or bubbles depending on
            either their thickness (if any) or else on the value of the
            Autocad system variable "PDSIZE". if the result is zero,
			then the entity is ignored.
            This option is off by default.

<a name="caveats"><h2>Caveats</h2></a>
<div>
    Please note that the AME solid modelling package by Autodesk as
	included in Autocad R10-R12 generates
    surfaces with surface normals pointing to the inside of the created
    volumes (at least most of the times...).
<p>
    Models created with the AME Solid modelling package must have surfaces
    defined with the command "SOLMESH". Otherwise they consist of only
    wireframe information wich cannot be extracted by Radout.
<p>
    The "SOLID" entities in Autocad, which can be extracted with the
    "Extruded and flat Solids" option, have nothing to do with solid
    modelling, AME or ACIS. These are a feature out of the 2D days of
	Autocad and are just flat quadrilateral faces which appear solidly
	filled when viewed from top. They form quadrilateral prisms if
	extruded, which can only be done in a right angle to their ground plane.

<p>
	Entities created with the ACIS solid modeller or custom entity
	types defined by any other 3rd party
	application ("proxies", previously "zombies") are ignored.
