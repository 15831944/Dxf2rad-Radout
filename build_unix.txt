Build instructions for dxf2rad
==============================

To build dxf2rad yourself, you need the suitable development
tool for C installed on your system. In most cases, this will
be some version of gcc and its associated toolchain.

In most cases, invoking the makefile in the toplevel directory
should do the trick:

$>  make -f dxf2rad.mf

This will build a dxf2rad executable in the same directory.
On "exotic" platforms, you may need to change some of the 
configuration options at the top of the makefile.


32 bit vs. 64 bit
=================

By default, the correct type of binary for your platform will
be built. If you want to build for a different platform than
the build system, then you can add "-m32" or "-m64" to the
CFLAGS string near the top of the makefile.


Stripping the executable
========================

If you have built in debug mode, you can strip the extra
information from the executable, thus making it smaller and
faster to load:

$> strip dxf2rad


Building Radout
===============

Autocad on Unix is long dead, and no working makefiles from
those historic times have been preserved.
