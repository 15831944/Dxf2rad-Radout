Building Radout
===============

The most recent Releases Radout has been built for were
Autocad R15, and Intellicad 2004.

Building with newer versions will probably require some
adaptation, which happens best by copying the interfacing
src/radout/main_*.cpp file and changing the copy.
Additionally, src/acis/acis_r*.cpp may also need changes.

The most recent compiler used was Visual Studio 2010.
The project files are included as examples from where to
convert to a more recent environment.
HINT: The project has undergone a major refactoring in the
mean time, with many files not residing in the same directories
anymore. 

Some assembly required...



Files from Autodesk
===================
You'll need the Autocad SDK for building.

DLL files

 * Autocad Release 15
	* acgex15.dll / acgex15_d.dll
	* acbr15.dll / acbr15_d.dll

	Libraries for extracting triangulated surfaces from ACIS solids.
	Those two DLLs come with the SDK, and may be distributed as
	part of the application.

	Similar libraries will be available for newer versions, but the
	license terms need to be checked for each one individually.


Source files in use:

 * adcolor.c  (originally colext.c)
 	Copyright Autodesk inc.
	Free license

 * ads_perr.c
	Copyright Autodesk inc.
	Free license



Files from Visio
================
You'll need the Intellicad SDK for building.

Source files in use.

 * entpoint.c
	Interface definition file
	Copyright Visio Corp.
	No formal license
	This file is necessary to build for Intellicad, and is included
	in their SDK. You need the SDK anyway for the libraries.
	Intellicad development is controlled by the Intellicad Technology
	Consortium nowadays.
